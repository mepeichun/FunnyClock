# Clock Zoo - 时光动物园

**Clock Zoo** is a collection of innovative clock designs, each capturing the concept of time in unique and artistic ways. This project aims to inspire you to slow down and appreciate every moment of life, with a variety of clocks that blend creativity and functionality.

## Overview

Time is gentle, flowing, and alive. As the years pass, many of us find it difficult to grasp time. Time is often associated with various dates and moments—it could be anticipation, remembrance, or even anxiety. In the Clock Zoo, time is portrayed as gentle and vibrant, offering a new perspective on how we perceive time.

## Features

- **Clock Matrix**: A digital clock made by neatly arranging multiple simulated mechanical clocks.
- **Time-Chasing Stickman**: A whimsical clock where a stickman relentlessly chases each second, with its reflection on the clock face.
- **Naughty Cat Clock**: A quirky and slightly absurd clock design.
- **More clocks coming soon!**
